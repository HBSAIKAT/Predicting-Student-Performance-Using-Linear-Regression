# **Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression**

This project aims to predict a student's academic performance index based on various factors such as hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample question papers practiced. The model uses a **Linear Regression** algorithm to make these predictions, providing an understanding of the key factors influencing academic performance.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that helps understand how different variables impact a student's academic performance. By leveraging machine learning, we can predict a student’s likely performance based on their study habits, previous academic results, extracurricular participation, sleep schedule, and practice efforts.

### **Features of the Model:**

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes the following features:
  - `Hours Studied` (numeric): The number of hours a student spends studying per week.
  - `Previous Scores` (numeric): The student's previous academic scores.
  - `Extracurricular Activities` (numeric): The number of extracurricular activities the student participates in.
  - `Sleep Hours` (numeric): The number of hours the student sleeps per night.
  - `Sample Question Papers Practiced` (numeric): The number of practice question papers the student has worked on.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 1.6467
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 4.3950
  - **R² Score (Accuracy)**: 0.9884
